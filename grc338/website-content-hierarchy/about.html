            <h2>Tale of the Toast</h2>
            <p>Our story starts from a lifelong love of boba. Growing up in Southern California, there was always a plethora of boba shops to go to, and getting boba with friends and family quickly became a regular activity during meetups. There is something so special and exciting about visiting a new cafe or trying out whatever new drink trend was hot. Committed to creating a community experience centered on bubble tea and pastries, Toast Tea Studio was launched in early 2022. With our first location in San Luis Obispo—a true college town—we hope to become a chill spot for students to get their work done while simultaneously providing amazing study fuel.</p>
